Deformation_width is in meters,
Roadway_slope is in degrees,
Collision_angle is in degrees,
Skidmark_length is in meters,
Crawl is in meters, Distance travelled without skidmark in meters,
BreakingEfficiency in percentage,if the vehicle has left four skid marks, the breaking efficiency is 100 percent. Subtract 20% for each front wheel 
                                 that did not leave a skid mark and 30% for each back wheel that did not leave a skid mark)
